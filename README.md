# EmacsDotD
My emacs configuration

1. Back up your .emacs.d and .spacemacs and delete them (rm -rf) if you have them
2. Clone this repo someplace handy
3. Copy or move the contents of this repo so that its .spacemacs and its .emacs.d are at top level in your home directory

If you're using a Mac, get rid of any other emacs build you're using and go straight here https://vigou3.github.io/emacs-modified-macos/. 
If you don't, you may have more installation ceremonials, keyboard hackery (the alt keys don't work right) to do before you can get going. 

Inside .emacs.d is another README.md that you will find useful. It explains how you can use VIM keymaps but emacs functionality. This is great for evangelizing things like org-babel to VIM users. Sort of like telling piano players that they can play the violin, only using exactly all the finger motions they already know for the piano, and no more.
